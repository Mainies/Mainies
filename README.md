7. **CLI Restaurant Menu in Java**
  - Created a menu interface for a hypothetical restaurant as part of a university. Includes OOP design and basic unit testing.
  - Link: [JavaMenuProgram](https://github.com/Mainies/AdvProgA1)

8. **Unsupervised Clustering Project**
  - Description: One of my early assignments, this project showcases my journey from a beginner to a more seasoned coder. It's a testament to strong exploratory data analysis and the exploration of clustering methods.
  - The project aimed to create data visualizations and identify candidates suitable for clustering within a dataset used to group employees based on their likelihood of resigning.
  - Utilized K Nearest Neighbors and DBSCAN Algorithms, applying a range of hyperparameter tuning techniques (Silhouette Score, Elbow Method w/Inertia) and metrics (Rand Index, Homogeneity, and Completeness) to evaluate models.
